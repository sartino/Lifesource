            <br>Welcome! My clients seek therapy for many reasons, often because of specific problems that cause anxiety and
            depression that interfere with functioning and stability. I enjoy helping you find the way through suffering
            to stability. My approach to healing is one of mindfulness. This is a gentle approach that becomes a respite
            from the speed of our world. The brutal messages of depression create self- doubt, confusion and anxiety. Restoring
            a place of clarity can pave the way for recovery and growth.
            <br>
            <br>My goal is to assist you in finding the strength and resources inside for skillful coping. Many struggle with
            the frantic pace of obligations and demands both at work and with family. Relationships can leave us with trauma
            that often must be revisited to reach stability for the future. Sometimes various roles conflict and create demands
            that leave us devoid of the energy and love we need to care for ourselves and others. Growth begins when we learn
            the skills to set respectful boundaries that allow us the space and silence to hear the beckoning and wisdom
            of our own intuition and knowing. Listening is important, especially to your heart.
            <br>
